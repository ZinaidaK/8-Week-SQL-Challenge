# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

This repository was created after completing the [Serious SQL](https://www.datawithdanny.com/courses/serious-sql) course provided by [Data with Danny](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datawithdanny/). 
It aims to showcase my skills in solving real-world problems using SQL. The repository contains comprehensive solutions for the eight challenging case studies from the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), demonstrating my proficiency in data analysis, query optimization, and SQL-based problem-solving.
